'l'ltis reel of rnlorofilm contains material
which llas paper color changes stains, or
illustratione, (some of witich may appear on
paqes mixed with printed text). ln orcler to

ensure that all text ancl illustrations are ,
leqible, exposure settinqs must be changed.

Theretore, when text and illustratione, exist
in a single image or when material
bacquouncls differ, such frames may need
to be exposed twice.

The first exposure reflects tlte camera
operator’s best etlort to capture the majority
of the text; tlte second exposure refleots tlte

camera operator’s best effort to capture
illustrative material or tlte remaining text. lt

is hoped that this practice will result in a
microlilrn product that fully serves the needs
